### This is my dashboard project for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard.).

The requirements for this project include creating an admin dashboard using CSS and HTML with an emphasis on using intermediate skills, especially CSS grid.

This project allowed me to practice my front-end skills to create an attractive and responsive dashboard. I focused a lot of effort into responsiveness starting at 810x1080 and downwards. There is also a small ammount of JS for darkmode functionality. I hope you enjoy!

Time spent: 22 hours.
